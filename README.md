# Prediction-of-the-risk-of-delays-in-learning-writing-from-pregraphism-via-serious-game-on-tablet

Dysgraphia is a specific learning disability that affects the fundamental functions of handwriting in absence of any intellectual and neurological deficits. It is associated with difficulties in fine motor skills, often related to problems in praxic skills, which prevents to automate the motor routine necessary for the graphic gesture realization.

- **Data**: data were collected with serious games for iPad, aimed at testing different characteristics of handwriting through pregraphic symbols. 
We focused on the analysis of alterations in the characteristics of handwriting and on the violations of the Isochrony and the Speed Accuracy Trade-off principles. 
The analysis of the confounders (age, gender, dominant hand, language, use of tablet) was carried out on these features, and datasets were created to train and evaluate a predictive model.

The impact of confounders was negligible, while a total of 22 features were selected as useful for the prediction.

- **Predictive Model**:

The predictive model was able to identify subjects at risk of delay in learning of handwriting, with a improvement of 25% compared to a baseline predictor. 

The most relevant innovation of the work consists in the possibility to objectively predict children at risk of a delay in learning graphical abilities, excluding the subjective component introduced by the teachers’ judgement, thanks to a quantitative analysis of pregraphic symbols, since pre-scholar age. 
In this way, those who will be identified as subjects at risk will have the opportunity to undergo to an empowerment program and simultaneously will be monitored in order to observe their graphic abilities’ evolution, even at distance of years, with the aim of confirm the predictions.
